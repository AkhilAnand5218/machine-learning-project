This project uses machine learning to classify plant growth stages in traditional 
(SA–SC) and IoT-based (TA–TC) greenhouses based on environmental data. 
Algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVC, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random 
Forest were tested, with Random Forest achieving 100% accuracy. A Gradio 
interface was built for real-time predictions, showing the class and greenhouse 
type. The project highlights the role of ML in improving greenhouse efficiency 
and decision-making.
